# Interview Buddy Userscript

## Introduction

Welcome to the Interview Buddy userscript, designed to assist you during online interviews by providing a stealthy way to access information (by hiding you switching tabs). This script allows you to highlight blocks of text using the `Cmd/Meta` key and copy them using the `Alt` key.

## Installation Instructions

To install and use this userscript, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Tampermonkey

1. **Install Tampermonkey**: Go to the [Tampermonkey website](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) and click on "Install" for your browser.
2. Follow the prompts in your browser to complete the installation.

### Step 2: Enable Developer Mode (Important)

**Note**: It's crucial for some scripts that you [enable developer mode](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=en#Q209) in Tampermonkey:

- Open Tampermonkey by clicking its icon in your browser toolbar.
- Click on "Dashboard."
- In some versions, enabling developer mode might be necessary.

### Step 3: Install Interview Buddy Userscript

2. **Tampermonkey Prompt**: Your browser should automatically detect this as a userscript file and prompt you with an installation dialog from Tampermonkey.
3. Click "Install" in this dialog box.

## Usage Instructions
